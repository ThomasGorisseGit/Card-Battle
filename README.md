# Card-Battle
Little project using Java. 

It is used for me to train MVC Architecture and Design Patterns. 

This repository implement a card game, 
2 players are given 7 cards.
Each player plays a card. The player with the higher card value wins the round.
The game finish when the players played all his cards.


This little project will allow me to implement AI algorithms.
The rules of the game can change.
